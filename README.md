# KIET-AID2-Team-14
# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection using CNN (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity.  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images.  
The model classifies whether a plant leaf is **healthy or diseased**, helping farmers take early action.
